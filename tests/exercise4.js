/*
- Import the `checkGuess` function from `/src/game-helpers.js`, and use it to validate each of the user's guesses
- When rendering the letters in the `Guess` component, apply the letter's `status` to the `cell` element.
- "Empty" guess slots should have the same markup as before: `<span class="cell"></span>`.
