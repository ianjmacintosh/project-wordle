/*
- Create a new component.
  - Don't forget, you can use an NPM script to generate the scaffolding for you! We learn how to do this in the [“Getting Started” video](https://courses.joshwcomeau.com/joy-of-react/project-wordle/04-overview)
- This component should render a `<form>` tag, including a label and a text input.
- The text input should be controlled by React state.
- When the form is submitted:
  - The entered value should be logged to the console (for now).
  - The input should be reset to an empty string.
- **The user's input should be converted to ALL UPPERCASE.** No lower-case letters allowed.
- The input should have a minimum and maximum length of 5.
  - **NOTE:** The `minLength` validator is a bit funky; you may wish to use the `pattern` attribute instead. This is discussed in more detail on the [Solution page](https://courses.joshwcomeau.com/joy-of-react/project-wordle/06-solution#an-alternative-to-minlength).
