/*
- Create a new `Guess` component. 6 instances should be rendered at all times, no matter how many guesses have been submitted.
- The `Guess` component should render 5 spans, each with the class of `cell`.
- Each cell should contain a letter, if the `Guess` instance has been given a value. If not, the cell should be blank.
- Use the `NUM_OF_GUESSES_ALLOWED` constant, when needed.
- No `key` warnings in the console.
